# Walmart-Analyzing-Customer-Spending-with-Confidence-Intervals-and-Central-Limit-Theorem

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of customer purchase behavior at Walmart. The primary goal of this project is to investigate differences in spending habits across various demographics, including gender, age, and marital status. The analysis leverages statistical techniques like Confidence Intervals and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to derive insights and provide actionable recommendations.

## Project Structure
- **Walmart_Confidence_Interval_CLT.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook where the data analysis, visualizations, and statistical tests are performed.
- **Data Folder**: Contains the dataset used in the analysis, detailing customer demographics and purchase data.

## Key Objectives
- **Demographic Analysis**: Assess how different demographic factors such as gender, age, and marital status influence spending behavior at Walmart.
- **Statistical Testing**: Utilize confidence intervals and hypothesis testing to identify significant differences in spending patterns.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize marketing strategies and target high-value customer segments.

## Key Findings
- **Gender Spending Patterns**: Male customers generally spend more on average than female customers. Marketing efforts should prioritize male customers to maximize revenue.
- **Age Group Insights**: The 26-35 age group shows the highest spending, making them a critical target for marketing and promotions. Spending significantly decreases in age groups above 55 and under 17.
- **Marital Status Impact**: Unmarried customers tend to spend more than married ones, suggesting that promotional strategies could be tailored differently for these groups.
- **City Category Influence**: Customers from City Category C have higher spending, indicating a potential area for increased sales focus.

## Recommendations
1. **Target High-Spending Demographics**: Focus marketing efforts on male customers, the 26-35 age group, and unmarried individuals to capitalize on their higher spending behavior.
2. **Product Category Optimization**: Prioritize products in categories 5, 1, and 8, which have shown high purchase frequency, while exploring strategies to boost sales in underperforming categories.
3. **City-Specific Strategies**: Enhance marketing efforts in City Category C, where customers exhibit higher spending, compared to Categories A and B.
